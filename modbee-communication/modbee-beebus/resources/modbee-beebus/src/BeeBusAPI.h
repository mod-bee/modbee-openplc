/**
 * Serialises one node's public surface against its own loop().
 *
 * The API has always been safe to call whenever suits the caller -- work is
 * queued and carried out on a later turn, so nothing depends on when a call is
 * made. What it never had to survive was two calls landing at the same instant,
 * because a node was only ever driven from one thread.
 *
 * A host runtime may not oblige. OpenPLC gives each IEC task its own thread and
 * runs their bodies in parallel, so servicing the node from a fast task while
 * the application blocks sit in a slower one puts two threads on one node: one
 * appending to the operation queue while the other walks it. That is a torn
 * read or a reallocation under the other thread's feet, not a stale value.
 *
 * Recursive, because the guarantee has to survive the callbacks. loop() raises
 * completion and topic handlers, and a handler is expressly allowed to queue
 * more work -- that call re-enters the API on the thread already holding the
 * lock, and a plain mutex would deadlock on the spot.
 *
 * Embedded targets compile the guard out: one thread, no cost, no <mutex>.
