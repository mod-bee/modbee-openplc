// --- Abstract transport interface ---

// The single point of contact between the protocol core and the outside world.
// The core reads and writes bytes; it never learns which medium carries them.
//
// Implementations live in src/transport/ and are selected by the application,
// so any platform can pair with any medium:
//
//                  Serial                          UDP
//   Arduino    BeeBusStreamTransport      BeeBusArduinoUdpTransport
//   Host       BeeBusHostSerialTransport  BeeBusHostUdpTransport
//
// Datagram transports present a byte stream by draining one datagram at a time.
// The framer resynchronises on SOF, so a datagram boundary needs no special
// handling in the core.

    // is therefore the one thing the transport already knows.
