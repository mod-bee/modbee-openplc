// --- Per-instance protocol configuration ---
//
// `BeeBusConfig{}` is the intended way to start a node. Every timing field
// defaults to BEEBUS_AUTO, meaning the node measures it: how long the token
// takes to come round, and how long each individual peer takes to accept it.
// That is the only way one configuration can suit a hardwired hop at 115200
// baud and the same hop over a radio, and the only way adding a node later does
// not mean revisiting every node already in the field.
//
// Setting a field to a number pins it and turns adaptation off for that field
// alone; the rest of the node still tunes itself. Nothing here has to be set
// for a network to work.
//
// Settings belong to the instance rather than the process, so several nodes in
// one process can each carry their own. Durations are milliseconds unless the
// name says otherwise.

    // is also the room a node waiting to join announces itself in, so it is not
    // merely dead air.
    //
    // There is no ordinary reason to set this. It exists for a transceiver that
    // needs longer to turn around than the line alone accounts for, and even
    // then a value here is a floor rather than a replacement: it is still
    // raised if the line turns out slower than it assumed.

    // the contention window starts, and the window then widens on evidence that
    // answers here need more room and narrows when they do not; joinCycleInterval
    // paces a node that is still alone. BEEBUS_AUTO uses
