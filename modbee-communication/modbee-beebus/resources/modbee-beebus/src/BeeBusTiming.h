// Measured network timing.
//
// Every timeout in the protocol is a multiple of how long the ring takes to
// come round, and that figure is measured rather than configured. Two
// quantities are tracked, because a mixed ring has two:
//
//   T_rot     a full rotation. Ring-wide, and the basis for membership,
//             isolation, operation and response timeouts.
//   T_hop[n]  how long node n takes to accept the token. One link, so a fast
//             peer and a slow peer get the timeouts they each deserve.

// Samples before an estimate is trusted.
#define BEEBUS_ESTIMATOR_WARMUP     4

// Bounds on any derived timeout.
//
// The floor is what this node can be relied on to schedule within: a timeout
// shorter than the interval between its own looks at the bus cannot be
// enforced, whatever the network is doing. It is measured from that interval,
// so a node running a tight loop derives a tighter floor than one carrying
// heavy application code. BEEBUS_TIMING_FLOOR_MS is what stands in until the
// interval has been measured, and MIN is the point below which millisecond
// clocks on two nodes no longer resolve the difference.
//
// The ceiling stops one pathological sample from stretching failure detection
// out of usefulness.
// Silence between frames assumed before the line rate is known from either
// the transport or the spacing of arrivals. Long enough to be safe on a slow
// line, and replaced the moment either says otherwise.

// Runs the byte time is the lowest of. A minimum rather than a mean, because a

// time, because a line's rate is not a constant: a repeater inserted, a radio
// module swapped, a port reopened at a different baud all make it slower, and
// an all-time minimum can never rise to meet that. Wide enough that one
// unusually fast run does not set the figure alone, short enough that a
// segment which really has slowed is believed within a rotation or two.
#define BEEBUS_BYTE_TIME_WINDOW     8

// Silence that ends a run of bytes arriving outside any frame. Long enough to
// hold a run together at any rate worth supporting; a run that swallows a gap
// only reports the line as slower than it is, and the lowest sample wins.

// Lower it to buy that memory back on a small target, and assign node IDs from
// 1 upward so the ring fits inside it: an address above this still joins, is
// still timed and is still a full member, but shares the pooled estimate rather
// than holding one of its own. Leave headroom for nodes added later, since a
// ring that outgrows the table degrades to less exact timing rather than
// failing, but only the addresses inside it are timed individually.
