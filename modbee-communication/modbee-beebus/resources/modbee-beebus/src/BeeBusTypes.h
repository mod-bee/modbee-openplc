//
// The window is stated rather than derived. Both sides have to agree on it or
// an answer lands after the solicitor has stopped listening, and a figure each

// a node that has just powered up has timed nothing like as much as the ring
// it is joining. Stating it makes the agreement structural, and leaves the
// value free to be measured.
//
// The round number is what makes the contention narrow. A node answers a given
// round once; whoever speaks first in a round wins it and the rest stand down
// until the next. So each round admits one node and the set still contending
// is strictly smaller, however the addresses fall.

// Rotations between a member's invitations once the line has shown it carries
// an announcement. A node that wants in says so and is invited on the turn
// after, so this is the sweep that catches an announcement nobody heard, not
