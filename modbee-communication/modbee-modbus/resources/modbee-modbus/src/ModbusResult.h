// WHAT HAPPENED TO AN OPERATION
// =============================================================================
//
// The contract, and it is the whole of what makes the queue trustworthy:
//
//   EVERY ACCEPTED OPERATION REACHES EXACTLY ONE CONCLUSION.
//
// Not "usually", and not "unless it was unconfirmed". An application that opens
// a slot per request and waits to be told can then hold that slot without ever
// stalling it.
//
// An operation that is accepted and silently never concluded does not look like
// a bug. It looks like a control loop that quietly stops issuing requests after
// a few hours, which is far harder to find.

enum class ModbusResult : uint8_t {
    // --- Accepted ---
    Queued = 0,       // Accepted; the outcome arrives on a later poll()
    Ok,               // Completed; the value is already in your variable

    // --- Refused before anything reached the wire ---
    NotInitialised,   // begin() has not been called
    InvalidArgument,  // Null pointer, zero count, or a quantity Modbus disallows
    NotMapped,        // A local address has no variable bound to it
    Duplicate,        // An identical operation is already pending
    QueueFull,        // The operation queue is at capacity
    UnknownUnit,      // The destination is not reachable
    Superseded,       // A newer write to the same address replaced it before it went out
    Cancelled,        // Discarded by clearPending() or a restart

    // --- Concluded on the wire ---
    Timeout,          // No response after every retry
    Refused,          // The server raised an exception; the exact code arrives via onError
    Acknowledged,     // Exception 0x05: accepted, and it will take a while. POLL, do
                      // not retry - the server is working on it.
    Busy,             // Exception 0x06: retry later. Distinct from Acknowledged, and
                      // the difference is the whole of what the caller does next.

// a build error instead of a value that means something else on the far side.
