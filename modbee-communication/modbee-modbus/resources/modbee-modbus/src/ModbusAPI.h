// THE ONE-OBJECT API
// =============================================================================
//
// `ModbusRTU`, `ModbusASCII` and `ModbusTCP` are one object each, and between
// them they are the whole library for most people:
//
//     ModbusRTU mb;
//
//     void setup() {
//         Serial1.begin(19200, SERIAL_8E1);
//         mb.begin(&Serial1, 19200);
//         mb.slave(17);                    // answer as unit 17
//         mb.addHreg(40, &setpoint);       // this variable IS register 40
//     }
//
//     void loop() {
//         mb.poll();                       // the whole contract
//     }
//
// --- Nothing here is a wall ---
//
// Everything underneath stays public and reachable: `client()`, `server()`,
// `map()`, `link()`, `poller()`. This object composes those; it does not hide
// them. Start here, and reach past it the day you need something it does not
// offer - without rewriting what you already have.
//
// --- Names ---
//
// Coil, Ists, Hreg, Ireg - the four Modbus tables under the names every Modbus
// library and every device manual uses. `Ists` is a discrete input; `Ireg` is
// an input register. They are not our names and it would not help anyone to
// invent better ones.

// A completion handler, for a caller that wants to be told. Optional
// everywhere: `mb.readHreg(17, 100, value)` is a complete call.
