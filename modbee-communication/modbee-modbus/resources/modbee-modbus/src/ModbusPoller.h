//
// Repeating reads into bound variables, with an honest answer to "should I
// still believe this".
//
// A Modbus client gives you a value. It does not tell you how old that value is,
// and a variable holding 21.5 says nothing about whether 21.5 is still true.
// That distinction is the whole difference between a number and a measurement,
// and it is what this layer adds:
//
//   Declare what to poll and how often     addPoll(...)
//   Values land in your own variables      no copying, no lookup
//   Ask whether to trust one               quality(), age()
//   Be told when it changes                onChange(), with a deadband
//
// Everything else in this library answers "what did that register say". This
// answers "what is that register, now".
//
// Everything else in this library answers "what did that register say". This
// answers "what IS that register, now" - which is a different question, and the
// one a control loop is actually asking.

// How much to believe a value.
