// =============================================================================
// PENDING OPERATIONS
// =============================================================================
//
// The queue between the application and the wire, and the reason this library
// is worth using rather than writing a request builder by hand.
//
// What the application gets, with no configuration at all:
//
//   Stacked      Operations queue as they are made. Nothing blocks and nothing
//                is sent inside the call that made it.
//   Deduplicated Queue the same read twice and the second is refused. Queue the
//                same write twice and so is that.
//   Superseded   Write a setpoint faster than the bus can carry it and the
//                QUEUED value is replaced, not stacked behind. A control loop
//                moving a setpoint every scan sends the value it settled on,
//                not a history of every step - and whoever was waiting on the
//                replaced write is TOLD, rather than left hanging.
//   Retried      With backoff and jitter, and then reported either way.
//   Concluded    Exactly once, always. See ModbusResult.
//
// --- Re-entrancy ---
//
// A completion handler is application code, and the natural thing for one to do
// is queue the next operation: chain a request, retry a write that failed,
// drive a state machine on. That call pushes onto the queue and reallocates it,
// so any reference, pointer or iterator held across a handler is left pointing
// at freed memory.
//
// The rule the whole class follows: AN OPERATION IS REMOVED FROM THE QUEUE
// BEFORE ITS HANDLER RUNS, AND NOTHING READS THE RECORD AFTERWARDS. Every path
// that concludes an operation goes through retireAt() so the rule is stated
// once.
//
// --- Storage ---
//
// Fixed, and allocated once: a slot per operation, the order they were queued
// in, one byte area for what they carry, and rings for the conclusions owed.
// A running node never allocates. Slots do not move, so a record's address is
// stable for as long as it is queued; the ORDER is what changes, which is why
// the methods below still work by position.

// What a read's destination buffer holds.
