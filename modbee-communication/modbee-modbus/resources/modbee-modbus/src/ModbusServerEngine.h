// Turns a request PDU into a response PDU against a data map. No I/O, no clock,
// no framing: the sessions carry the bytes and this decides what they mean.
//
// One engine serves every session, because what a server exposes does not
// depend on which client is asking. What IS per-session - framing, transaction
// state, which unit ids to answer for - lives in ModbusSession.

// Identity returned by 0x2B/0x0E Read Device Identification, and by 0x11 Report
// Server ID. How a commissioning tool tells one device from another, and worth
// filling in: the alternative is an integrator reading a register map to work
// out what they are looking at.

// another may only read, that a command register only accepts values from a
// known set. Without it those rules have nowhere to live but inside the

//
// Three of the public codes have no generic implementation, because what they
// address is device-specific by definition:
//
//   0x14 / 0x15  Read / Write File Record - a file store this library does not
//                have and should not invent
//   0x18         Read FIFO Queue - a queue belonging to the application
//
// And a device may implement vendor codes in 65..72 or 100..110, which the
// specification reserves for exactly that.
//
// Rather than refuse all of them for ever, an application can serve any code it
// likes. Write the response PDU BODY into `out` - the function code is written
// by the engine, so start at the first byte after it - and return its length.
// Return 0 and set `exception` to refuse; return 0 with `exception` left at
// MB_EX_NONE to answer with silence, which a broadcast or a listen-only mode
// needs.

// The request has already been decoded as far as its structure allows and has
// passed the access filter, so a handler sees the same view every built-in
// function does.
