// =============================================================================
// A SERVER FACING MANY CLIENTS
// =============================================================================
//
// One data map and one engine, N connections.
//
// This is the shape a serial server does not need and a TCP one cannot do
// without. A Modbus TCP server faces several clients at once - a SCADA package,
// an HMI, an engineer's laptop, all polling the same device - each with its own
// socket, its own transaction stream and its own lifecycle.
//
// WHAT IS SHARED is what the device exposes: the data map, the identity, the
// access rules. WHAT IS PER CONNECTION is framing and transaction state. Making
// that split explicit is the whole of the design; everything else follows from
// it.

// Which framing accepted connections speak.
//
// RTU over a TCP socket is not Modbus TCP - it is a different thing with the
// same port number, produced by every terminal server ever sold. Supporting it
// is a one-line choice here and saves an integrator a day.
