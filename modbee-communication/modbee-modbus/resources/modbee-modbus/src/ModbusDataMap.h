// THE DATA MAP
// =============================================================================
//
// What a server exposes: the four Modbus tables, bound to the application's own
// variables. No I/O and no clock; the server engine drives it and the sessions
// never see it.
//
// --- Bindings, not storage ---
//
// The map does not hold register values. It holds the ADDRESS of the caller's
// variable, and reads or writes through it for as long as the server runs. The
// application's `uint16_t level` IS holding register 30; nothing copies between
// them and nothing can get out of step.
//
// A bound variable must therefore OUTLIVE the map, or be unbound before it is
// destroyed. Static, global or member storage is the usual answer; a local in a
// function that returns, or an element of a container that reallocates, leaves a
// live pointer to memory that is gone, and nothing here can detect it.
//
// --- Four ways to bind ---
//
//   scalar    one address to one variable. Right for a sparse map: twelve
//             registers scattered across the address space.
//   block     a range of addresses to an array. Right for a PLC's contiguous
//             %IW / %QW areas, where a scalar binding per register would mean
//             ten thousand entries and a lookup through all of them.
//   string    text packed two characters to a register, NUL terminated.
//   handler   a range served by a callback, for values that are computed rather
//             than stored - a scaled reading, a bit assembled from elsewhere,
//             a register that must be read from hardware at the moment it is
//             asked for.
//
// All four are the same thing underneath: a run of addresses with something
// behind it. That is what makes overlap detection one function rather than six.

// What happens to an output when the master stops talking to us.
//
// A safe state is a property of the plant, so it is stated per address.
// HoldLastValue is the default, because driving an output is an action and
// doing it unasked is its own hazard.
enum class ModbusFailsafe : uint8_t {
    HoldLastValue = 0,
    ResetToValue,

// Serves a range of addresses from something other than a variable. `offset` is
// from the start of the bound range, not from address zero, so a handler does
// not have to know where it was bound.
//
// A read handler returns the value; a write handler returns false to refuse the
// write, which the engine reports as an illegal data value.
